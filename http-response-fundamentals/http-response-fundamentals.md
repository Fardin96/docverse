## Basics

1. **Understanding HTTP Requests and Responses**
   - **What is an HTTP request?**: An HTTP request is a message sent by a client to a server, asking for a resource or action.
   - **What is an HTTP response?**: An HTTP response is the message sent back from the server to the client, containing the requested resource or an error message.
   - **Structure of HTTP messages (headers, body)**: HTTP messages consist of headers (metadata) and a body (the actual data). For example:
     ```javascript
     // Example of an HTTP request
     fetch('https://api.example.com/data', {
       method: 'GET',
       headers: {
         'Content-Type': 'application/json'
       }
     });
     ```

2. **Content-Type Headers**
   - **Importance of `Content-Type` headers**: This header indicates the media type of the resource. For example, `application/json` tells the server that the body content is JSON. Other common content types include:
     - `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`: Used for form submissions.
     - `multipart/form-data`: Used for file uploads.
     - `text/plain`: Used for plain text data.
     ```javascript
     // Example of sending form data
     const formData = new URLSearchParams();
     formData.append('username', 'JohnDoe');
     formData.append('password', '123456');

     fetch('https://api.example.com/login', {
       method: 'POST',
       headers: {
         'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
       },
       body: formData.toString()
     });
     ```

3. **Common HTTP Status Codes**
   - **Overview of relevant status codes**: 
     - `2xx OK`: The request was successful.
     - `4xx Bad Request`: The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax.(client-side error)
     - `404 Not Found`: The server could not find the requested resource.
     - `5xx Internal Server Error`: The server encountered a situation it doesn't know how to handle.(server-side error)

4. **HTTPS (HTTP Secure)**
   - **What is HTTPS?**: HTTPS (HTTP Secure) is the encrypted version of HTTP that uses TLS/SSL encryption to secure the communication between client and server.
   - **Why use HTTPS?**: HTTPS protects sensitive information during transmission and is essential for secure applications, such as online banking and e-commerce.
   - **Visual indicators**: Browsers show a padlock icon in the address bar for HTTPS connections, indicating a secure connection.

## Intermediate

5. **Understanding the TLS Handshake**
   - **TLS Handshake**: The TLS handshake is the process that establishes a secure connection between the client and server. It involves several steps:
     1. The client sends a "ClientHello" message to the server, including supported cipher suites and a randomly generated number.
     2. The server responds with a "ServerHello" message, selecting a cipher suite and sending its digital certificate.
     3. The client verifies the server's certificate against trusted certificate authorities (CAs).
     4. Both parties generate session keys based on the exchanged random numbers and the selected cipher suite.
     5. A secure connection is established, and data can be transmitted securely.

6. **Certificate Validation**
   - **How browsers validate SSL/TLS certificates**: Browsers check the validity of the SSL/TLS certificate presented by the server. If the certificate is self-signed or not trusted, users may encounter warnings.
   - **Potential errors**: Common errors include "Your connection is not private" or "Certificate not trusted," which indicate issues with the certificate.

7. **Performance Considerations**
   - **Modern HTTPS**: HTTPS has minimal performance impact compared to HTTP due to improvements like HTTP/2 support and TLS 1.3, which optimize the connection process and reduce latency.

8. **HTTPS-only Features**
   - **Secure origins**: Some browser features, such as geolocation and service workers, are only available on secure origins (HTTPS). This ensures that sensitive data is handled securely.

9. **Asynchronous Nature of HTTP Requests**
   - **Why is it asynchronous?**: Fetching data is asynchronous because it allows the browser to continue executing other code while waiting for the server's response. This is crucial for maintaining a responsive user interface. When a fetch request is made, the browser sends the request and immediately returns control to the JavaScript execution context, allowing other operations to proceed. The `await` keyword is used to pause the execution of an async function until the promise is resolved, ensuring that the data is available before proceeding. 

   - **Clarification on `await` and Asynchronous Behavior**: While using `await` does pause the execution of the async function, it does not block the entire JavaScript execution context. Other asynchronous operations can still run, and the user interface remains responsive. This means that while the function waits for the response, the browser can handle user interactions, animations, and other tasks, providing a smooth experience.

10. **Request and Response Body Formats**
    - **Formats beyond JSON**: Other formats include `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` for form submissions and `multipart/form-data` for file uploads. Here's how to handle these data types:
      ```javascript
      // Handling multipart/form-data
      const formData = new FormData();
      formData.append('file', fileInput.files[0]);
      fetch('https://api.example.com/upload', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: formData
      });
      ```

11. **Request/Response Body Size Limits**
    - **Explanation of size limits**: Servers often impose limits on the size of request bodies to prevent abuse, such as denial-of-service attacks. For example, a server might reject requests larger than 1MB. Common implications include:
      - **Client-side errors**: Clients may receive a `413 Payload Too Large` error.
      - **Server-side handling**: Implementing checks to validate the size of incoming requests.
      ```javascript
      // Example of handling size limits on the server-side (Node.js)
      app.post('/upload', (req, res) => {
        if (req.body.length > 1e6) { // 1MB limit
          return res.status(413).send('Payload Too Large');
        }
        // Process the request
      });
      ```

12. **Error Handling**
    - **Common errors when fetching data**: Handle errors gracefully using `.catch()`.
      ```javascript
      fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
        .then(async response => {
          if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
          }
          return await response.json();
        })
        .catch(error => console.error('Fetch error:', error));
      ```

## Advanced

13. **Understanding Response Body Consumption**
    - **Why the response body can only be read once**: The response body is a stream that can only be consumed once. After reading it, the stream is closed. The response body is a stream that can only be consumed once because it is 
    designed to be consumed in a single pass. Once the data is read, the stream is closed, and any further attempts to read it will 
    result in an error. This design is based on the underlying implementation of streams in web APIs, which optimizes memory usage and 
    performance by allowing data to be processed as it arrives.
      ```javascript
      fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
        .then(async response => {
          const data1 = await response.json(); // First read
          const data2 = await response.json(); // Error: body already consumed
        });
      ```

14. **Cloning Responses**
    - **How to clone responses**: Use the `response.clone()` method to create a copy of the response.
      ```javascript
      fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
        .then(response => {
          const clone = response.clone();
          response.json().then(data => console.log(data)); // First read
          clone.text().then(text => console.log(text)); // Second read
        });
      ```

15. **Streaming Responses**
    - **Handling large data sets**: Use the `ReadableStream` interface to process large responses incrementally.
      ```javascript
      fetch('https://api.example.com/large-data')
        .then(response => {
          const reader = response.body.getReader();
          // Read the data in chunks
          reader.read().then(function processText({ done, value }) {
            if (done) return;
            console.log(new TextDecoder("utf-8").decode(value));
            return reader.read().then(processText);
          });
        });
      ```

11. **Understanding Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**
    - **CORS Overview**: CORS is a security feature that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. This is to prevent malicious websites from making unauthorized requests on behalf of users.
    - **How to enable CORS**: To allow cross-origin requests, the server must include specific headers in its response:
      - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`: Specifies which origins are allowed to access the resource.
      - `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`: Specifies which HTTP methods are allowed when accessing the resource.
      - `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`: Specifies which headers can be used in the actual request.
    - **Example**:
      ```javascript
      // Example of setting CORS headers in an Express.js server
      app.use((req, res, next) => {
        res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*"); // Allow all origins
        res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE"); // Allow specific methods
        res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Content-Type"); // Allow specific headers
        next();
      });
      ```

## Not Obvious Concepts

17. **Single Consumption of Response Body**
    - **Why trying to read the same response body twice throws an error**: The response body is a stream that can only be read once. Attempting to read it again results in an error. 
    - The response body is a stream that can only be consumed once. After reading it, the stream is closed. The response body is a stream that can only be consumed once because it is 
    designed to be consumed in a single pass. Once the data is read, the stream is closed, and any further attempts to read it will 
    result in an error. This design is based on the underlying implementation of streams in web APIs, which optimizes memory usage and 
    performance by allowing data to be processed as it arrives.

18. **Differences Between `response.text()` and `response.body`**
    - **When to use each method**:
      - `response.text()`: Returns a promise that resolves with the body as a string.
      - `response.body`: Returns a `ReadableStream` of the body, allowing for more control over how the data is read.
      ```javascript
      fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
        .then(response => {
          const text = await response.text(); // Use for simple text
          const stream = response.body; // Use for streaming
        });
      ```

19. **Response Body Encoding/Decoding**
    - **Details about encoding and decoding**: The response body may be encoded in various formats (e.g., UTF-8). Use appropriate methods to decode it.
      ```javascript
      fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
        .then(async response => {
          const text = await response.text();
          const decoder = new TextDecoder('utf-8');
          const decodedData = decoder.decode(new Uint8Array(text));
          console.log(decodedData);
        });
      ```

20. **Body Parsing Pitfalls**
    - **Handling unexpected data types**: Be cautious of unexpected data types in the response body, which can lead to parsing errors. Use try-catch blocks to handle these scenarios.
      ```javascript
      fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
        .then(async response => {
          try {
            const data = await response.json();
            console.log(data);
          } catch (error) {
            console.error('Parsing error:', error);
          }
        });
      ```

21. **Chunked Transfer Encoding**
    - **How browsers and servers handle chunked transfer encoding**: This allows data to be sent in chunks, enabling the server to start sending data before the entire response is ready. This is useful for large responses or when the server needs to send data incrementally.
      ```javascript
      // Example of a server sending chunked responses (Node.js)
      app.get('/stream', (req, res) => {
        res.writeHead(200, { 'Transfer-Encoding': 'chunked' });
        setInterval(() => {
          res.write('Chunk of data\n');
        }, 1000);
      });
      ```

22. **Reading Response Headers**
    - **How to read response headers**: Response headers can provide important metadata about the response. You can access them using the headers property of the response object.
      ```javascript
      fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
        .then(async response => {
          console.log(response.headers.get('Content-Type')); // Get the Content-Type header
          const data = await response.json();
          console.log(data);
        });
      ```

## Common Methods for Handling Request Bodies

23. **Common Methods for Handling Request Bodies**
   - `JSON.stringify(object)`: Converts a JavaScript object to a JSON string.
     ```javascript
     const data = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
     const jsonData = JSON.stringify(data); // '{"name":"John","age":30}'
     ```
   - `await response.text()`: Reads the response body as plain text.
     ```javascript
     fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
       .then(async response => {
         const text = await response.text();
         console.log(text);
       });
     ```
   - `await response.json()`: Parses the response body as JSON. This method reads the response body and parses it as JSON in one step.
     ```javascript
     fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
       .then(async response => {
         const data = await response.json(); // Reads and parses JSON
         console.log(data);
       });
     ```
   - `await response.blob()`: Reads the response body as a Blob, useful for binary data.
     ```javascript
     fetch('https://api.example.com/image')
       .then(async response => {
         const blob = await response.blob();
         const imgURL = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
         document.querySelector('img').src = imgURL; // Display the image
       });
     ```
   - `await response.formData()`: Reads the response body as FormData, useful for form submissions.
     ```javascript
     fetch('https://api.example.com/formdata')
       .then(async response => {
         const formData = await response.formData();
         console.log(formData.get('key')); // Access form data
       });
     ```
   - `await response.arrayBuffer()`: Reads the response body as an ArrayBuffer, useful for raw binary data.
     ```javascript
     fetch('https://api.example.com/binary')
       .then(async response => {
         const buffer = await response.arrayBuffer();
         console.log(new Uint8Array(buffer)); // Process binary data
       });
     ```
